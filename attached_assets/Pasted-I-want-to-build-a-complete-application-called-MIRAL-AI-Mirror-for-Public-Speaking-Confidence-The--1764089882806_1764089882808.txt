I want to build a complete application called MIRAL – AI Mirror for Public Speaking Confidence.
The system will help users practice speeches and presentations using real-time AI feedback.
We are starting from scratch, so please understand the full scope before generating anything.

🌟 PROJECT OVERVIEW
MIRAL is an AI-powered virtual mirror that uses the webcam to analyze:


Eye contact


Facial expressions


Posture & body language


Emotions


Voice tone, speed, confidence, filler words


Clarity and structure of speech


It acts like a smart “practice partner” for interviews, presentations, meetings, debates, and public speaking.
At the end of the session, the app generates a detailed performance report.

🎯 CORE FEATURES WE WANT
1. Real-time video analysis


Face detection


Eye-contact tracking


Posture correctness


Body movement patterns


Emotion detection (happy, nervous, confident, neutral)


2. Real-time audio analysis


Speech-to-text


Filler words counter


Voice tone & pace


Energy level


3. On-screen feedback during practice


“Maintain eye contact”


“Speak a little slower”


“Try smiling”


“Improve posture”


4. Final performance report
Must include:


Confidence score


Eye contact percentage


Emotion timeline


Pace (WPM)


Filler words graph


Transcript


Strengths & weaknesses


Tips for improvement


Comparison with previous sessions


5. User dashboard


History of sessions


Progress tracking


Scores over time



🧠 TECHNOLOGY STACK (Suggested but flexible)
Backend


FastAPI (Python)


OpenCV (for video)


A face detection model (NOT Mediapipe, because it is problematic on Windows)


An emotion recognition model


Whisper / SpeechRecognition for audio


Numpy, Pydantic


Any simple ML models for posture detection


Frontend
Choose one:


React


Next.js


Flutter Web


Should include webcam recording and real-time display of metrics.
Database


MongoDB or PostgreSQL



📌 API Endpoints Required
POST /analyze-video-frame
POST /analyze-audio
POST /save-session
GET /session/{id}
GET /user-progress


🔧 EXPECTED OUTPUTS FROM YOU (THE AI TOOL)

Audio processing endpoint


Report generation logic


Session storage logic


3. ML / CV logic


How to detect eye contact


How to detect posture


How to score confidence


How to detect emotions


How to score the user


4. Frontend structure


Webcam capture


Real-time indicators


Final report screen UI


Dashboard UI


5. Database schema


User model


Session model


Reports model


Analytics model


6. Setup instructions
Installation guide
Dependencies

How to run frontend

📣 IMPORTANT
We are building this from zero.
Assume no code exists yet.
Create everything from scratch in the most efficient and scalable way.

🎁 GOAL
By the end, I want a complete working blueprint + starter code + instructions to turn MIRAL into a production-ready AI mirror that improves people’s public speaking skills.

If you'd like, I can also generate:
✅ A README.md for GitHub
✅ A launch plan
✅ A UI design prompt
Just tell me!
